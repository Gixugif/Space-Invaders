Synopsis

in an HTML5 Canvas element.


Installing
--------------
Installing this is simple. You don't really need to install it. Just
download the source, unpack the archive and then run index.html in your
web browser.

How To Play
---------------
This is like the classic Space Invaders arcade game, although a bit more
simplified. The goal is to destroy all of the enemies while avoiding being
destroyed yourself.

You move left and right using the arrow keys on your keyboard and you can
shoot using either of the CTRL keys. You can only fire one bullet at a time.

You can die in 3 ways:
- Getting hit by an enemy bullet
- Colliding with and enemy
- An enemy reaches the bottom of the screen

You have 3 lives. When all your lives are lost the game will reset, setting
your score back to zero, however if you manage to defeat all of the enemies,
the game will reset and your score will remain the same.

See how high a score you can get!
